    API endpoint that allows assets to be created, viewed, searched, filtered, and ordered
    by any field.

    To order by a specific field you need to include in your GET request a parameter called
    ordering with the name of the field you want to order by. You can also order in reverse
    by adding the character "-" at the beginning of the name of the field.

    You can also use the parameter search in your request with the text that you want to search.
    This text will be searched on all fields and will return all possible results

    You can also filter by a specific field. For example if you only want to return those assets
    with name "foobar" you can add to your GET request a parameter called name (name of the field)
    and the value you want to filter by. Example ?name=foobar (this will return all assets
    that have as name "foobar").
